# Features
* Syntax highlighting
* Compile and run AGK projects
* Debugger using breakpoints and REPL

# Notes
* Only tested in Windows
* Only works with AGK Classic as Studio doesn't expose the compiler executable

# TODO
* Open help when pressing F1 in a built-in function
* Autocomplete built-in functions
* Intellisense (?)
* Built-in test runner
* Add help command in debugger

# Thanks

compiler from the CLI.
