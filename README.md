# atom-agk package
Use Atom to develop games with AppGameKit! This plugin adds support for the
AppGameKit Tier 1 (BASIC) language and all the utilities you'd expect from a
modern editor, such as syntax highlighting, intellisense, on-demand compilation,
and a REPL-oriented debugger.

# Features
* Syntax highlighting
* Compile and run AGK projects
* Debugger using breakpoints and REPL
* Autocomplete functions, types, globals and variables [WIP]
* Open help when pressing F1 in a built-in function [WIP]

# Notes
* Only tested in Windows
* Only works with AGK Classic as Studio doesn't expose the compiler executable

# Thanks
Particular thanks to the guys at TheGameCreators forums and in particular
[MadBit](https://forum.thegamecreators.com/user/16e3dff53459a69a78e8c26031783c78)
for all the help running the debugger and using the compiler from the CLI.
