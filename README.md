# Features
* Syntax highlighting for AppGameKit Tier 1 (BASIC)
* Compile + Run just by pressing F5 (can be configured, or use command pallette)

# Notes
* Only tested in Windows
* Only works with AGK Classic as Studio doesn't expose the compiler executable

# TODO
* Open help when pressing F1 in a built-in function
* Autocomplete built-in functions
* Run in debug mode
* Intellisense (?)
* Built-in test runner
